# Nutriscot

NutriScot is a data-driven research initiative that investigates how machine learning, biomonitoring, and AI-generated meal plans could help combat obesity and diet-related diseases in Scotland. The project aims to personalise dietary recommendations based on individual health data while supporting NHS Scotlandâ€™s efforts in weight management.

This is a hypothetical project conducted for research and learning purposes. It does not represent an actual NHS or government programme.

The data used for this analysis comes from the Scottish Health Survey, accessed via the UK Data Service.
